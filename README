Chef Overlay for Gentoo

To use this overlay, pull it down via GIT and add it to PORTDIR_OVERLAY in your make.conf

You will probably need to add some package.keywords for the various packages to be able to install them.

app-admin/chef and app-admin/chef-server

Currently merb-core depends on json_pure and the Opscode gems on json. These two have conflicting files so you'll need to add something like this to your make.conf:

    # evil hack
    COLLISION_IGNORE="/usr/bin/edit_json.rb /usr/bin/prettify_json.rb /usr/lib64/ruby/gems/1.8/bin/edit_json.rb /usr/lib64/ruby/gems/1.8/bin/prettify_json.rb"

To start the client, just run /etc/init.d/chef start

This whole thing is a work in progress.  Please submit patches or merge requests.
